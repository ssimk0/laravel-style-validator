## <a name="issue"></a> Found an Issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can
help us by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our [GitHub
Repository](https://github.com/ssimk0/laravel-style-validator). Even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#submit-pr)
with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> Want a Feature?

You can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ssimk0/laravel-style-validator).

If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with a
proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

*   For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so
    that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our
    efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so
    that it is successfully accepted into the project.
*   **Small Features** can be sent directly [as a pull request](#submit-pr).

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already
answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues. Providing the following information
will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

*   **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack
    trace helps
*   **Library Version** - what version of Validator is affected (e.g. 1.0.0)
*   **Motivation or Use Case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the
    current behavior is a bug for you
*   **Reproduce the Error** - provide an unambiguous set of steps
*   **Related Issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
*   **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point
    to what might be causing the problem (line of code or commit)

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

*   Search [GitHub](https://github.com/ssimk0/laravel-style-validator/pulls) for an open or closed PR that relates to your
    submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.

As [mentioned above](#feature), Pull Request should generally be small in scope.
Anything more complex should start as an issue instead. Some examples of types
of pull requests that are immediately helpful:

*   Fixing a bug without changing the public API.
*   Fixing or improving documentation.
